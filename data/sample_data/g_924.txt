How OptiKey was being used
OptiKey (primary/left) mouse click key was used with zoom locked on. I was in a Teams meeting where I was screensharing, and I tried to use the mouse click action with zoom to click on the screensharing toolbar. The overlay/toolbar was not visible in the zoomed in image.

What the user expected to happen
I expected to see the toolbar in the zoomed in view, and I expected to be able to click on a button.

What the user actually experienced
The overlay/toolbar was not visible in the zoomed in image.

Version
Operating system and version: Windows 11
OptiKey Pro version 3.2.5.0
Microsoft Teams version 24295.605.3225.8804
Steps to reproduce the issue
Start a call in Teams.
Share your screen.
Make sure mouse zoom is on.
Use the primarly click key to try to zoom in on the screensharing toolbar.
Any other information that helps to describe and/or reproduce the problem
Interestingly, the screen sharing toolbar is also not captured in screenshots. And in fact the toolbar disappears as soon as you press win+shift+s.

I just tested and confirmed that the same behavior occurs with all the standard mouse actions. There's nothing special about left/primary click. Any mouse action with a zoom step shows the same behavior.

@tqphan When I use the magnifier in lens view, I just see a black rectangle instead of the zoomed in view. this seems to be somewhat of a known problem, but I wasn't able to quickly resolve it with the strategies suggested.

Maybe someone else can test it out?

Just to be clear, I was seeing a black rectangle even when trying to zoom in on the desktop. Hopefully my (solid gray) desktop background doesn't have drm...

@tqphan I was able to resolve the issue with the lens view of Windows Magnifier only showing a black rectangle by updating my graphics drivers.

I can now verify that the Teams screen sharing toolbar does NOT appear in the zoomed in view in windows magnifier, lens mode.
