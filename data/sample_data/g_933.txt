App previews from taskbar
On my personal PC:
-appears behind docked or floating keyboard
-appears behind keyboard regardless of whether hovering over with the mouse or using keyboard navigation with win+t and arrow keys

On my work PC:
-When using a docked keyboard and navigating with keystrokes (win+t, arrow keys), Optikey disappears when focus moves to a window preview. (This is really bad behavior because it has the potential to strand an OptiKey-only user with no way to navigate anywhere without using a physical keyboard or mouse!)
-When using the docked keyboard and navigating with the mouse, window previews are hidden underneath the docked keyboard.
-Floating keyboards have the same behavior as docked keyboards.
