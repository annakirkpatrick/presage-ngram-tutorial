How OptiKey was being used
Dynamic keyboard, DirectInput gamepad trigger (have also tried standard keyboard and dwell trigger, same behavior in both cases)

I selected the win key and then the l key.

What the user expected to happen
Windows should lock the screen.

What the user actually experienced
The letter 'l' was typed in the target application. The screen did not lock.

Version
Windows 10
OptiKey version 3.2.4.0
Steps to reproduce the issue
type win then l
Any other information that helps to describe and/or reproduce the problem
I have verified that win+l does lock the screen when using a physical keyboard.

Some other win shortcuts do work, e.g. win+v for clipboard history (requires enabling clipboard history in Windows settings)
